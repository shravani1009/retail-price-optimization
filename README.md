# Retail Price Optimization -

In today's competitive retail market, setting the right price for products is crucial. This project focuses on retail price optimization using machine learning techniques to predict customer satisfaction scores. This is a crucial part of developing dynamic pricing strategies, leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction.

**Problem statement:** Our task is to develop a model that predicts the optimal price for a product based on various factors. This prediction would enable us to make an informed decision when pricing a product, leading to maximized sales and customer satisfaction.

The dataset's diverse features like product details, order details, review details, pricing, competition, time, and customer details provide a comprehensive view for our price optimization task.
